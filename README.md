Recently, I completed a guided project focused on data cleaning with MySQL. This hands-on experience gave me a practical understanding of database operations and equipped me with the skills to clean and organize messy datasets using MySQL queries.

Data cleaning, a critical step in data analytics, involves identifying and rectifying inaccuracies, inconsistencies, or gaps in datasets to ensure their reliability for analysis. Learning to implement these processes in MySQL has been both insightful and rewarding. Iâ€™m excited to apply these skills to manage and analyze large, real-world datasets efficiently.

Key Learnings:
Data Import and Export

Learned to import CSV files into MySQL databases and export cleaned data back into usable formats. This skill is essential for integrating real-world data from various sources.
SQL Queries

Gained proficiency in SQL commands like SELECT, WHERE, GROUP BY, HAVING, ORDER BY, LIMIT, and more to filter, manipulate, and analyze data effectively.
Joins and Unions

Practiced combining data from multiple tables using joins (inner, left, right, and self joins) and unions to create consolidated datasets.
String Functions

Worked with built-in string functions like LENGTH, UPPER, LOWER, TRIM, REPLACE, and SUBSTRING to process and clean text data.
Case Statements

Learned to use case statements for conditional logic in SQL queries, similar to if/else statements in programming.
Subqueries and Common Table Expressions (CTEs)

Explored techniques for writing subqueries and using CTEs to simplify complex queries and enhance code readability.
Advanced Features

Gained exposure to window functions, temporary tables, stored procedures, and triggers for more advanced data management and analysis tasks.
The Data Cleaning Project:
In this project, I cleaned a dataset plagued by issues such as duplicates, missing values, and inconsistent formatting. The steps included:

Loading the Dataset

Imported raw data from a CSV file into MySQL Workbench.
Removing Duplicates

Identified and eliminated duplicate entries using DISTINCT and DELETE statements.
Standardizing Formats

Cleaned data by trimming whitespace, correcting inconsistent values, grouping categories, and updating incorrect column datatypes to ensure uniformity.
Handling Missing Values

Used MySQL functions to locate null or missing values and decided whether to fill or remove them based on context.
Optimizing Data Structure

Removed unnecessary rows and columns with no meaningful values to streamline the dataset.
Creating a Clean Dataset

Exported the cleaned data for further analysis
